## Requirements

- Windows 7 (or newer)
  Sadly right now I (Glort) have got only the Windows version. I'll think about making versions for Mac OS and Linux in the future. This is my first serious project ever.

- An IDE (preferably [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), since we made this in Visual Studio and it might not work on another IDE)

- C# extension

- [GTK# for .NET](https://www.mono-project.com/download/vs/#download-win)

## Customization

The application should look like this

You can customise your icon if you want by opening the options of GtkStuf and clicking on "Applications", too.

## Contributions

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please join my Discord server, where we can clearly discuss about your plans (either DM or server).

[![Glort's Discord Server](https://invidget.switchblade.xyz/TRWRhbJp6W)](https://discord.gg/TRWRhbJp6W)

Or open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. (Unrecommended, since I'm not a big Github user for now).

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
